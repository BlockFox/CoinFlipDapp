This is a DAPP project from the Ethereum Smart Contract Programming 201 course by Ivan on Tech.
Many thanks to Ivan and Filip for education on https://academy.ivanontech.com/

CoinFlip is a DApp where you can bet with a 50:50 chance of winning like any other coin toss game. 

The Web implementation is far from being finished. Animations and error handling are missing. The website should only reflect the functionality of the Smart Contract.
